//While I have some idea of what this kata requires, I truly do not know where best to even start - psudo break down below, real break down to follow!

//Time stamps may not be in order, functionality is needed to return date stamps and tags in chronological order

//Convert time stamp data into a more readable array

//Use array to work out which guard has the most time asleep

//Use array indexes to work out if there are any overlaps in minutes asleep to find a common time where they are likely to be asleep

//multiply the guard ID that is most asleep by the minute they are most likely to be asleep
